Landing Page Project

# Project Overview

This project is to build a basic webpage given two design images.
One is of the complete website. The other contains font and color details.

## Skills To Be Developed

By completing this project I should be able to demonstrate and develop the
current skills I have in HTML & CSS. This should test my knowledge of CSS
flexbox, ability to organize and write readable and coherent code, and
help reinforce the git commands and practices I have learned.
